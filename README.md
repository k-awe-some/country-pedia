# CountryPedia

Fully responsive, [Where in the World](https://country-pedia.firebaseapp.com) is an interactive list that contains information of countries around the world.

## Description

Created with **React.js** and powered by the **REST Countries API**, the current version of this web app allows users to either _search for a country's information_ by its name or _filter countries by region_. Routing between countries is also possible thanks to the implementation of **React Router DOM**.

A dark mode is integrated for readability purposes.
